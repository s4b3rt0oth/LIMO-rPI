# LIMO-rPI
Motion activating LIFX lights with a PI Zero W and PIR sensor.

The only requirement is the lifxlan module from pip.

```
pip install lifxlan
```

This was built with python2.7 but it has ran on python3. There are some minor changes to syntax needed to run on 3. I kept it at 2.7 because that's what my version of Raspbian shipped with and I didn't feel like changing it.
